The circuit is designed to act as Automatic Night Light, It turns on an  LED when ambient light falls below a certain threshold The circuit  uses the LDR to sense light levels. If the light is dim (LDR resistance  increases), the op-amp output goes high, turning on the transistor and  lighting up the LED.
